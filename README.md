Influence of Pollutants on Circulatory and Respiratory Diseases

Project: Mortality Data Analysis and Prediction
## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of mortality data, with a specific focus on respiratory and circulatory diseases. The analysis explores mortality rates among different demographic groups, investigates regional variations, and assesses the potential impact of pollution on mortality rates. By integrating pollution data sourced from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the project aims to identify potential connections between pollutants and mortality rates.

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

    * Analyze mortality data, focusing on respiratory and circulatory diseases.
    * Explore disparities in mortality rates between males and females.
    * Investigate geographical variations in mortality rates and identify potential contributing factors.
    * Integrate pollution data from the EPA to assess its potential impact on mortality rates.
    * Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the number of deaths based on relevant variables.
    * Enhance the understanding of mortality patterns and identify potential risk factors.
    * Explore the effect of pollution on respiratory and circulatory diseases.
    * Assess the predictive capabilities of various machine learning models in estimating the number of deaths.

## Dataset

The analysis will be conducted using a mortality dataset that contains gender-specific fatality records. This dataset enables an exploration of disparities between males and females in terms of mortality. Additionally, the dataset includes information on various ICD codes, providing valuable insights into mortality trends related to respiratory and circulatory diseases.

## Integration of Pollution Data

The project enriches the mortality analysis by integrating pollution data obtained from the EPA. The EPA is a reputable agency responsible for monitoring and regulating environmental pollution. By combining this pollution dataset with the mortality data, the project aims to investigate potential connections between different pollutants and mortality rates.

## Methodology

The analysis will follow a multi-step approach:

    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform descriptive analysis on the mortality dataset to gain insights into mortality patterns, disparities, and regional variations.
    * Integration of Pollution Data: Merge the EPA pollution dataset with the mortality data to investigate potential links between pollution and mortality rates.
    * Machine Learning Models: Utilize various machine learning techniques to develop models that predict the number of deaths based on relevant variables, such as pollution levels, demographic characteristics, and other factors of interest.
    * Interpretation of Results: Analyze the findings from both the descriptive analysis and machine learning models to identify potential risk factors, understand the effect of pollution on respiratory and circulatory diseases, and assess the predictive capabilities of the models.

## Potential Impact

The results presented in this report have the potential to:

    * Inform public health interventions aimed at reducing mortality rates related to respiratory and circulatory diseases.
    * Guide policy formulation to address environmental pollution and its potential impact on population health.
    * Inspire further research on the intricate interactions among mortality, pollution, and other factors influencing public health.

## Disclaimer

It's important to note that the conclusions and predictions drawn from the analysis are based on the data available at the time of the study. Correlation does not imply causation, and the findings should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, as with any analysis of this nature, there might be limitations, such as data quality, missing information, and potential confounding factors.
